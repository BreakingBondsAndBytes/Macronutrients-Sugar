        <h1>Macronutrients: Sugar</h1>
        <h3>Sugar is one of three macronutrients and is also known as a carbohydrate</h3>
        <p>
            Sugar is a macronutrient and commercial sugar is known as sucrose, a glycosidically-bonded glucose and fructose. <br/> Another term for sugar is carbohydrate. Carbohydrates are composed chemically of carbon and water, the elemental <br/> composition
            being carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The molecular formula for sucrose is C12H24O6. It is important <br/> to realize that the molecular formula for glucose and fructose is the same; however, the structural arrangement is different. <br/> This
            means that glucose and fructose are isomers. Commercial sugar, or sucrose, contains 4 calories per gram. <br/>

        <h3>The Scientific Method Applied: Sugar Dissolution Rate with Varying Water Temperatures</h3>
        <p>
            A common experiment for journeyman scientists is seeing how fast sugar dissolves when you change the temperature.<br/> Let's explore with simulated results.

        <h4>
            Asking a Question Based on Observation
        </h4>
        <p>
            Scenario: You take a medicine pill and dissolve it in water before you drink it every night before bed. <br/> You notice that when you use hot water it dissolves faster; when you use cold water it dissolves slower. <br/> A few weeks later
            you find out it was a sugar pill being used as a placebo. You begin to wonder if the water <br/> temperature had an effect on the rate at which it dissolved. This drives you to form a hypothesis.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Forming a Hypothesis Which Is an Educated Guess
        </h4>
        <p>
            If sugar is dissolved in water at higher temperatures, then it will dissolve faster
        </p>

        <h2>Forming an Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Based on the like dissolves like principle it makes sense that sugar would dissolve effectively in water. <br/> With regards to the dissolution rate, we can say that the space in between water molecules increases as the temperature increases.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Our hypothesis was correct, the rate of sugar dissolution in water increases with the increase in water temperature.
